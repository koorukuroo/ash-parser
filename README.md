# ash-parser

Attempt to reproduce a [Chen and Manning (2014)](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/danqi/papers/emnlp2014.pdf) style neural network parser in Python and TensorFlow. Many elements copied rather shamelessly from [SyntaxNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet) (thanks Google!)

Currently used TensorFlow version is 0.12.0-rc0. Will migrate to 1.0 soon.

parsing-config file is required to be created in the model directory before execution.

Full documentation will come after the thing actually runs. (I wouldn't recommend trying at this point in time :-) Just hold on a bit)
